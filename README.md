### Intro

Hello, I am Hira, currently a full-stack software engineer (open for opportunities) with a prior experience in academia as a Research Assistant in the broad areas of internet measurement, networks security and privacy research.

### Cover Letter (of sorts) for my prior experience

My recent work in front-end/full-stack engineering roles involved working with front-end technologies such Angular, Ionic, React, Typescript as well as HTML/CSS, Tailwind to build robust front-end mobile and desktop applications. Prior to this, I was part of a team of an early-stage startup, and my work involved laying down the groundwork for the company's backend and front-end using front-end technologies such as React and backend with Express, Mongodb and Node. I also worked with AWS Lambda and AWS Eventbridge to build a framework for an event-driven audit trail as well as Github Actions to lay down a basic CI/CD pipeline. These experiences were valuable in giving me an idea of how code deployment pipelines work. 

In addition to the experience in the industry, my years in academia working on research gave me valuable experience into web security and privacy that allows me to think more deeply and robustly about web technologies in a privacy/security-centric way. My experience in networks, network security as well as web security also gives me a wholistic perspective on the web and how it works. Academia also gave me an opportunity to build and work on entire software pipelines using Python, its libraries such as (numpy, pandas, sci-kit, flask + network libraries) as well as Linux automation tools and Javascript for collecting, cleaning, analyzing and visualizing data.
